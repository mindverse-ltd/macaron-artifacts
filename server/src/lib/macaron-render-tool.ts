# Imports — ONLY these specifiers, no relative paths, no other packages, no fences

- ONE import from \`'$macaron/ui'\`, preferred over raw div/span: Stack, Row, Grid, Card+CardHeader/Title/Content, Button, Badge, Text, Input, Switch, Slider, Table, Tabs, Stat, StatGrid, Timeline…
- \`import { sendUserMessage, useAutoSend } from '$macaron/chat';\` — never \`window.sendUserMessage\`.
- Charts: \`'$macaron/ui/charts'\` (not 'recharts'). Icons: \`'lucide-react'\`.
- React: named imports. \`React.x\` also needs \`import React from 'react';\` or the render fails.

# Interactivity

\`sendUserMessage(prompt)\` posts \`prompt\` as if the user typed it, driving the next turn. Event handlers only. Phrase it as the user would ("Book the 3pm slot"), folding in every value that turn needs.

\`const left = useAutoSend(prompt, seconds?)\` — for a confirm widget with a default ("commit unless you say otherwise"). Counts down and sends \`prompt\` itself if the user does nothing; \`left\` is the seconds left, or \`null\` when nothing counts. Render \`left\` on the default button — that is the whole contract:

\`\`\`tsx
const COMMIT = 'Commit it.';
const left = useAutoSend(COMMIT, 30);
<Button onClick={() => sendUserMessage(COMMIT)}>Commit{left !== null ? \` (\${left}s)\` : ''}</Button>
\`\`\`

ONLY on real evidence of the habit ("just commit", "don't ask me", repeated approvals); else the same buttons without it. Seconds MUST show on the button. Same string in both calls.

# Rules

- One \`export default function App()\`, no fetch/network, helpers at module scope.
- UnoCSS Tailwind v3 classes via className. Stable \`key\` from data, never \`key={i}\`. No \`as any\` in JSX.
- Visible copy in the user's own language, not English.
- Changing an EXISTING component: Read its source and byte-copy the real markup, assets, and copy — only the property under change varies. A mockup makes the choice meaningless.
- After: ONE sentence of ack, never the code or the layout.`;
