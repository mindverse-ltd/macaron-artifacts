// wrote actually COMPILES and MOUNTS through our import map, or that a real
// mouse click on a $macaron/ui <Button> reaches sendUserMessage. This page runs
// the production renderer (GenuiPreview → StaticGenUIRenderer) and the
// production host bridge (createScheduleBridge), then reports what happened on
// window.__harness so Playwright can assert on it.
//
// Driven by scripts/smoke/clickable.mjs; not linked from the app.
